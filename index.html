/*
normalize the users guess
   -lowercase the users key press value

validate the users guess
  - user should only press r,p, or s
  -check that user key is in computerChoices
  -if the value is not part of the array alert user know they need to pick again 
  out of the 3 options r, p, or s
  - alert user what they picked
  - if the user picks a valid key move forward
Compare the user key to the computer key to determine who wins
Rock: wins against scissors, loses to paper, and ties against itself.
Paper: wins against rock, loses to scissors, and ties against itself.
Scissors: wins against paper, loses to rock, and ties against itself.
  - each round alert the winner
